# Udacity's Intro to Tensorflow Notes

#### Terminology

- **Artificial intelligence:** A field of computer science that aims to make computers achieve human-style intelligence. There are many approaches to reaching this goal, including machine learning and deep learning.
- **Machine Learning:** a set of related techniques in which computers are trained to perform a particular task rather than by explicitly programming them. 
- **Neural Network:** a construct in Machine Learning inspired by the network of neurons (nerve cells) in the biological brain. Neural networks are a fundamental part of deep learning.
- **Deep Learning:** a subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks.
